# Abstract

Marine prokaryotes play crucial roles in ocean biogeochemical cycles, being their contribution influenced by their growth rates. Hence, elucidating the variability and phylogenetic imprint of marine prokaryotes' growth rates are crucial for better determining the role of individual taxa in global biogeochemical cycles. Here, we estimated prokaryotic growth rates at high phylogenetic resolution in manipulation experiments run in the four astronomical seasons with different treatments that reduced known limiting growth factors, such as predators, nutrient availability, viruses and light. Single-amplicon sequence variants (ASVs)-based growth rates were calculated from changes in estimated absolute abundances using total prokaryotic abundance and the relative abundance of each individual ASV. The growth rates obtained were consistent with other estimates based on total cell-counts, CARD-FISH subcommunity cell-counts or metagenomic-OTUs, which supports our results. Our calculations unveil a broad range of growth rate values, from around 0.3 d-1 to almost 10 d-1 with significant variability even within closely related ASVs. High numbers of responsive (i.e. growth > 1 d-1) ASVs were shared between winter and spring seasons in most treatments, and all over the year in the treatments where nutrient limitation and viral pressure was reduced. The most responsive ASVs were rare in the in situ communities, comprising a large pool of taxa with the potential to rapidly respond to environmental changes. In essence, our results highlight the lack of phylogenetic coherence in the range of growth rates observed, and differential responses to the various limiting factors, even for closely related taxonomic groups.![image](https://github.com/onadeulofeu/Single-ASV-based_prokaryotes_growth_rates/assets/85949575/bdcaf2dc-a3d9-4933-a939-e2e5d3b9e4e3)
